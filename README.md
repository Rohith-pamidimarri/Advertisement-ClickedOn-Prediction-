# Logistic Regression Project: Predicting Ad Clicks

## Overview

In this project, I worked with an advertising dataset to predict whether a particular internet user would click on an advertisement based on various user features. The main goal was to create a logistic regression model that could accurately predict ad clicks based on user characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on the site in minutes
- 'Age': customer age in years
- 'Area Income': average income of the geographical area of the consumer
- 'Daily Internet Usage': average minutes a day consumer is on the internet
- 'Ad Topic Line': headline of the advertisement
- 'City': city of the consumer
- 'Male': whether or not the consumer was male (binary: 0 or 1)
- 'Country': country of the consumer
- 'Timestamp': time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window
- 'Clicked on Ad': target variable, 0 or 1 indicating clicking on the ad

## Project Steps

1. Data Exploration: I began by exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, identify any missing values, and understand the relationship between different features.

2. Data Preprocessing: After analyzing the dataset, I performed data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. Gradient Descent Algorithm: Instead of relying solely on pre-built libraries, I implemented my own logistic regression algorithm using gradient descent from scratch. This allowed me to have a better understanding of the optimization process and fine-tune the model accordingly.

4. Model Training: I trained the logistic regression model on the training data using the custom gradient descent algorithm and tuned the hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

5. Model Evaluation: Next, I evaluated the model's performance on the test dataset, calculating accuracy and other relevant metrics. I compared the results with the accuracy obtained using scikit-learn's logistic regression implementation to validate the correctness of my custom algorithm.

6. Results: The logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97%, which was in line with the accuracy obtained using scikit-learn's logistic regression.
